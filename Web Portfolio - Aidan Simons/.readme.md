                    |  AIDAN'S PORTFOLIO SITE  |             17 04 2020

When I started developement of the site, I was not at all designing it
in mind that I would have to manually recreate it in css. This did 
cause a bit of confusion in some areas for me where I was stumped a few 
times on how to make things look exactly the same as the mock up.

One of the more obvious examples of this would be the non existent grid
background that was clearly missing from a few sections of the site but
I managed to get around this by not having the grid design and still
styling the page well by adding extra dividing lines and borders
throughout the page to substitute.

Another major thing was me not being able to get flexbox to work with 
the .box_x divs and due to a lack of time I just found a way to lay out 
out nicely and make it work. A few miscillanious other things besides 
that, and everything else was personal stylistic changes I made due to 
changing my mind after the fact.

Whenever I do an excersise like this I am always reminded how important 
it is to pre plan divs and tags as I will occasionally find myself 
coming up with too many class names on the spot and then forgetting 
them in the styling proccess. During this excersise I made sure to pre 
plan class names and keep track of divs with notes I took beforehand.

One more note worth mentioning, the origional XD mockup was the clean 
one page design, but I implimented the idea of having a seperate gallery 
page and contact page somewhere along the post stages so that is why 
there is no actual mockup for the two layouts, I made them specifically 
for this assignment.
